## File Structure

``` /bin ``` is short for **binaries**, things like ```ls```

``` /sbin ``` is binaries for **admin** users

``` /boot ``` is for **booting**, of course

``` /dev ``` is where **devices** live, hardware, partitions

``` /etc ``` where **config** for system-wide things like apt are stored

``` /lib ``` **libraries** for applications to use, contains various functions

``` /media ``` other **mounted** drives, usb, hard drives

``` /opt ``` **optional**, manually installed software junk, DIY software

``` /proc ``` sudo files for system **processes**

``` /root ``` is **root** user's home folder

``` /run ``` temp fs file system, runs in ram, early **runtime** processes

``` /snap ``` **snap** packages, run independently

``` /srv ``` **service** directory, files accessed by external users if using server

``` /sys ``` dear old friend, way to interact with the kernel, created when **system** boots

``` /tmp ``` **temporary** files, used in a sessions for saving crashed app data, emptied on reboot

``` /usr ``` user **application** folder, non-essential for basic system operation

``` /var ``` **variable** directory, holds folders and files that are expected to grow in size, like log files, mail db

``` /home ``` **personal** files and documents, one for each user
